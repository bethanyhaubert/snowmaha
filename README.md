After bundle install, run the server with ruby main.rb. Then go to http://localhost:4567 to view the site.

Make sure you CTRL+C to quit the server and then restart the server whenever you change main.rb! Sinatra doesn't auto-reload when you change files like Rails does. You can add the sinatra-reloader plugin (Google it.) if you want, but that's not a priority I think.
